## Shortcodes

Albums Wow theme also provides powerful shortcodes to display albums with dynamic queries. Hereâ€™s how you can use them:

### [albums_wow_lists]

This shortcode uses `WP_Query` to display albums. You can customize the query by passing attributes.

#### Available Attributes:

- `posts_per_page`: Number of posts to display per page (default: value from `get_option('posts_per_page')`).
- `orderby`: Order the posts by a specific field (default: `date`).
- `order`: Sort the posts in ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`) order (default: `desc`).
- `single`: Filter by single taxonomy (default: empty).
- `genre`: Filter by genre taxonomy (default: empty).
- `hide_filters`: Boolean to show or hide filters (default: `false`).

#### Example Usage:

```php
[albums_wow_lists posts_per_page="5" orderby="title" order="asc" genre="rock"]
```
This will display 5 albums, sorted by title in ascending order, filtered by the "rock" genre.
### [albums_wow_lists_wpdb]

This shortcode uses `wpdb` for custom SQL queries to display albums. You can pass a custom query through the attributes.

#### Available Attributes:

- `query`: Custom SQL query to run (default: `empty`).
- `hide_filters`: Boolean to show or hide filters (default: `false`).

#### Example Usage:

```php
[albums_wow_lists_wpdb query="posts_per_page=10&post_status=draft&genre=rock" hide_filters="true"]
```
This will display 10 albums, sorted by title in ascending order, filtered by the "rock" genre. Filters hidden.
